# Image-Segmentation
In computer vision, image segmentation is the process of partitioning a digital image into multiple segments. The goal of segmentation is to simplify and/or change the representation of an image into something that is more meaningful and easier to analyze.
To train this model I used CamVid dataset. The Cambridge-driving Labeled Video Database (CamVid) is the first collection of videos with object class semantic labels, complete with metadata. The database provides ground truth labels that associate each pixel with one of 32 semantic classes.
Training CNN is a VERY computationally intensive task, so I used a technique called **Transfer Learning**, it uses a pretrained CNN on *Imagenet Dataset* known as **resnet34**. It gives state-of-the-art accuracy and is very much less computationally expensive. 
I used a model called **Unet**, which is a **U** shaped CNN. It takes input a image, scales it down to a single number i.e the output of the first part of the CNN, it then upscales that single number back to a image. Hence, **Unet** takes input an image from camera and gives output a *segmented* image. It works with a state-of-the-art accuracy of 91.47%. It can be even improved by using a higher value of batch-size, but it's computationally quite expensive.
